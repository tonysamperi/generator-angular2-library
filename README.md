## PACKAGE DEPRECATED!!
Hello and thanks for choosing *generator-ng5-library*
This package is no longer mantained, I suggest you tu use the new [generator-ngx-lib] instead!!
The new version uses a more compliant standard of packaging and it provides an easy way of testing your libraries, without the need of awful things like *lite-server* and *playground*.
All you have to use is **angular-cli**!!

Thanks

Tony
